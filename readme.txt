This game is made for pyweek 30,
All assests are not made by me, some are edited and some are completely raw. 

I have mainly used pygame to create this so do install that before running this code. I have kept code fully simple as you can see only one python file and no object oriented programming. Main reason for this was that, this is my first game, yes I had created snake game before but I wont  include that as mine since I created that with tutorials.

This game is fully open source and anyone can use it anywhere as they want.

Thanks for reading..
